A programmatic art project to experiment with a concept of algorithmic beauty.

Hand-coded using javascript and CSS, this piece is created entirely in code using and manipulating my perlin library (https://github.com/jamesmonks/perlin-fun). Feel free to experiment yourself with the code and artwork.

You can view it via [GitHub Pages](https://jamesmonks.github.io/Sunset/).
